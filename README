Ham-Packet-DXSpider

This is a small module designed to connect to a DXSpider server and 
enable the storage and retrieval of messages from that server.
DXSpider forms part of the DXCluster network where Radio Hams share
DX Spots. These messages are also received and can be acted upon.
The module allows for hooks so that code can be run when messages arrive.
